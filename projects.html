        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of most of the projects that I've worked on and what I've learned and used with them. The
            first 3 from the main page might also be here, if they are, they will have some more additional information
            about them. Most of these projects should have a link to the code/project, but some will not have any code
            at the moment, I have yet to upload some. </p>

                    <h2>Make A Website for Change</h2>
                    <p>As I stated on the main page, this was a project that had the theme of, "If you wanted
                        to bring awareness for something or to create change in your community, what website would
                        you build to spread the word?". I chose Open-Source software as my cause because I believe Open Source Software can be very beneficial to the average user. Open source software is important to me because it gives users the freedom to do the things they want while also respecting their privacy--unlike proprietary software. The goal of this website was to get the average user to consider using Open Source Software, as it leads to more benefits when compared alongside of proprietary software.

                    <h2>A Choose Your Own Adventure Game</h2>
                    <p>Again, I might be reiterating some stuff I said in the first page, but this was a project that I
                        tried to do something different with what was given to me. The way that one would usually go
                        about handling buttons and changing the story was a bit redundent and annoying, at least in my
                        opinion. A lot of the time working on this project was spent towards trying to find a new way to
                        handle the User Choices, so to speak. Unfortunately, I didn't get a major amount of time to
                        style the page, but the page was supposed to have a very similar theme to what was actually
                        being played. </p>

                    <h2>A Buzzfeed-Style Quiz</h2>
                    <p>This was another project that was aimed towards handling user input. Now, there was nothing
                        special with how I went about this project here, the one thing that you might notice is the
                        amount of selections/choices one could make here. Unfortunately, I did not get this website to
                        work in time, and I didn't get to style it. I was able to get one of the endings to work.</p>

                    <h2>Tetris</h2>
                    <p>This was a project making the popular game, Tetris in C++ with a library called Raylib. It was a
                        very minimal videogame library/framework, only having the documentation inside of a single
                        header file. This got me to work with C++ again, it had been a while since I had done anything
                        with C++. This was a massive refresher. I got introduced to new concepts within C++ that I
                        either barely knew or didn't know at all. </p>

                    <p>This was one of my favorite projects to <span class="special">ever</span> work on, as this got me
                        to fully understand how a computer works from boot, all the way to POST. This was a really fun
                        project getting to test myself with bascially having to write everything, as there was no
                        standard library that I could invoke. Unfortunately, the code has been lost to time. I was only
                        able to find one image of it working at all, but it was very barebones. Theoretically, I could
                        get it working on bare metal, but never tried.</p>

                    <p>A while back, I heard about this new programming language that piqued my intrest. It was said to
                        be a good systems programming language, and so I took that to heart. One of the first big
                        projects that I worked on in Rust was this barebones OS that I made after following some
                        tutorials and whatnot. This actually kind of functions, it would detect input from your keyboard
                        and print it out to the screen. This was another major learning experience for me. Honestly,
                        there's so much more I could do and that I want to do after knowing some more things.</p>

                        This was a small project I did last year to get
                        used to Rust, I worked on it some more this
                        January to get used to some more concepts that I
                        was needing to tackle. Recto, as I named it in
                        my computer, was a GNU Nano inspired editor.
                        This was a very fun project that involved
                        filesystem I/O, understanding how terminal apps
                        functioned, and how to write to a buffer.

                        use it on my main system. Well, one day I decided to customize my Linux install and the
                        applications that I use to my liking, and so here's what I got. I use Neovim as my text editor
                        and Hyprland as my desktop.</p>

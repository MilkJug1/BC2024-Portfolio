# MilkJug's Portfolio

Hello there! This will be my personal Portofolio after my internship is done, once I get done working on everything. I will move everything out of this project into a personal one. This will be alongside [my blog](https://milkjug1.github.io).


Once I also get better with working in Web Dev, I will combine both the websites together, yes both the blog and this will be into one. Without any design issues (<-- I'm prob going to eat those words later on lmao)

Please know that this website is not finished, and I plan to do a lot. Please read the [TODO](./TODO/Todo.md) file to learn more about what all is planned and working at this current moment.


And Plus, I plan to get this off of this fork and make it my own thing. That might be a bit hard but we'll see.

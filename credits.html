            <p>This is all of the resources, other people's code, inspiration, and more that I used for assisting in the
                development in this website. It will first go on a per page basis, and then general credits. I want to
                say thanks to all of the people that I asked for comments on and inspiration. This website wouldn't have
                been as good without you. Thank you.</p>

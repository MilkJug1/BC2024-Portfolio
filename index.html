                        <span class="special">Mechanical Engineering</span>. I first learned programming when I was

                        doing it ever since. I enjoy working on various kinds of projects, but I mainly work with

                            <p>
                                This was one of the earliest projects that we
                                did at my internship. The whole theme of this
                                project was; "If you wanted to make a change in your community, what would a website
                                created to spread the news look like?". This was my earliest full
                                experience using CSS and HTML--as before, I had only interacted with it a little. You
                                can even see some of the earliest
                                ideas for my portfolio come up in this website. For example,
                                the gradients, the color scheme, and the
                                animations all inspired different aspects of my portfolio.

                                This was a really fun project to do, I wish I
                                had gotten time to style it since I was really
                                happy with the end result. This was a project
                                with the notion of a "Choose your own
                                adventure"-type game, since it was a small
                                little game. I decided to base this off of
                                another game that I was really fond of. The
                                styling may not be there, but I do recommend
                                looking at the code, I spent a lot of time
                                figuring out a new way to handle user input.

                            <p>
                                This was a quiz, more specifally, in the style
                                to the ones you would see on a website like
                                Buzzfeed, where after answering a bunch of
                                questions, you get told what you are/what you
                                have. This was "completed" in a day, tho was
                                never fully finished. I was struggling with
                                getting an idea for this project, though I did
                                get most of the functionality going. I was wjust
                                about to work on the results half of the
                                project, until I ran out of time. I didn't get a
                                chance to fully customize the page, which is
                                fine. This was where I got the most knowledge of
                                javascript, our task was to get the user input
                                and store it.

                        This is a massive project that I am currently working
                        on, the idea for this project is to get Oculus(Or as its
                        know as, Meta)'s Link, a program/software, that allows
                        for a user of the Quest VR headset, to use it as a PCVR
                        headset. Unfortunately, there is no *offical* build for
                        Linux or any working thing. This will be built with a
                        mix of Rust and C++, this is a project that is still in
                        development, and has been for about a year or 2 now.
